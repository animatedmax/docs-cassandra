# DataStax OpsCenter

The DataStax OpsCenter product can be accessed at `https://pivotal-datastax.<your-system-domain>`

The credentials can be found in OpsManager by clicking on the DataStax Enterprise tile and selecting `Credentials` from the top.

We currently recommend you only expose the credentials to the Operations team as there is only a single user at present.

We suggest that you do not make any changes to cluster configuration via the DataStax OpsCenter as the configuration is automatically generated by the Tile.
